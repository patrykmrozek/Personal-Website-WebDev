                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p class="about-p">Welcome to my personal web page. I'm Patryk, a passionate first-year Computer
                    Science
                    student in UCC
                    discovering the depths of the world of technology.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p class="about-p">When I was just one year old, my family moved from Poland to Ireland.
                    Although I was very young at the time, this transition laid the foundation for my multicultural
                    upbringing.
                    Growing up between these two countries from such an early age instilled in me a sense of
                    adaptability and an
                    appreciation for diverse backgrounds, shaping my worldview in profound ways.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="about-info">
                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p class="about-p">I'm all about innovating and problem-solving, and I can't wait to use what I've learned
                    to jump into areas like software development, AI, or cybersecurity. I want to be where the action is,
                    pushing boundaries, learning non-stop, and tackling challenges as chances to grow.</p>

                <p>I'm a huge football fan, and I'm all about <i>Manchester City</i>. Watching them play is my jam—the tactics,
                    teamwork, and those epic moments on the field keep me hooked. It's not just a game; it's a rollercoaster
                    of emotions that makes me love football even more, especially when it's City showing their unstoppable spirit.

                <img src="images/gym.png" alt="bicep curl">
                <p>In early 2022, I embarked on my gym journey, and it's been a constant ever since.
                    Initially, it was about learning the ropes, but it quickly turned into a regular habit.
                    The gym's atmosphere and the progress I've seen, both physically and mentally, keep me motivated.
                    It's more than just exercise; it's about feeling strong and focused.
                </p>
                <p>My workout routine follows the Arnold Split, inspired by <i>Arnold Schwarzenegger's</i> training philosophy.
                    This method organizes my weekly workouts to focus on specific muscle groups each day—chest and back,
                    shoulders and arms, and legs. It's a structured approach that ensures each muscle gets attention while allowing
                    ample recovery time. This split has been a game-changer, helping me achieve a more balanced and effective fitness routine.
